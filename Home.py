### 3️⃣ Topic Modeling

✔️ Uses unsupervised machine learning (LDA) to discover hidden themes.  
✔️ Helps businesses understand trending discussions without manually reading all comments.  

### 4️⃣ Word Cloud Visualization

✔️ Helps businesses identify strengths and weaknesses in their products.  

### 7️⃣ Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)  
✔️ Extracts sentiments associated with specific aspects of a product/service.  
✔️ Example:  

🔹 *“The battery life is terrible, but the camera is great.”*  

- **Battery Life → Negative**
